# 🧱 Ubuntu Toolbox

> *"Everything is awesome when you're working with scripts!"*

Welcome to the Ubuntu Toolbox - your collection of LEGO-like building blocks for Ubuntu/Linux server administration! Each script is designed to snap together perfectly, helping you build and maintain your infrastructure piece by piece.

## 🏗️ What's in the Box?

This toolbox contains modular scripts and utilities for common Ubuntu server tasks. Each tool is designed to:
- 🔧 Work independently (like a good LEGO brick)
- 📝 Be well-documented and easy to understand
- 🎯 Solve a specific problem
- 🔗 Play nicely with other tools

## 📦 Available Bricks

### Coming Soon!
We're currently building our first set of bricks. Check back soon for:
- Server setup and hardening scripts
- Application installers (Nextcloud, Docker, etc.)
- Backup and maintenance utilities
- Network configuration helpers
- Security tools

## 🎨 How to Use

Each script in this toolbox follows a simple pattern:

```bash
# 1. Clone the toolbox
git clone https://github.com/MaBoNi/ubuntu-toolbox.git
cd ubuntu-toolbox

# 2. Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh

# 3. Run it!
./scripts/your-script.sh
```

## 🧩 Contributing

Got a useful script? We'd love to add it to the toolbox! Just remember:
- Keep it modular (one brick, one purpose)
- Add clear documentation
- Include error handling
- Test on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (and note compatibility with other versions)

## 📖 Script Categories
